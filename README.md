# A-I-Virtual-Mouse.....-

    AI virtual mouse system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional mouse system to perform and control the mouse functions,
and this can be achieved with the help of a web camera that captures the hand gestures and hand tip and then processes these frames to 
perform the particular mouse function such as left click, right click, and scrolling function.

For the purpose of detection of hand gestures and hand tracking, the MediaPipe framework is used, and OpenCV library is used 
for computer vision [7–10]. The algorithm makes use of the machine learning concepts to track and recognize the hand gestures and hand tip.

              The main objective of the AI virtual mouse system is to control the mouse cursor functions by using the hand gestures instead of using 
a physical mouse. The proposed system can be achieved by using a webcam or a built-in camera which detects the hand gestures and hand tip
and processes these frames to perform the particular mouse functions.

From the results of the model, we can come to a conclusion that the proposed AI virtual mouse system has performed very well and has a 
greater accuracy compared to the existing models and also the model overcomes most of the limitations of the existing systems. Since the 
proposed model has greater accuracy, the AI virtual mouse can be used for real-world applications, and also, it can be used to reduce 
the spread of COVID-19, since the proposed mouse system can be used virtually using hand gestures without using the traditional physical 
mouse.

The model has some limitations such as small decrease in accuracy in right click mouse function and some difficulties in clicking and 
dragging to select the text. Hence, we will work next to overcome these limitations by improving the finger tip detection algorithm to 
produce more accurate results.

Applications:

The AI virtual mouse system is useful for many applications; it can be used to reduce the space for using the physical mouse, and it can be used in situations where we cannot use the physical mouse. The system eliminates the usage of devices, and it improves the human-computer interaction.

Major applications:
(i)	The proposed model has a greater accuracy of 99% which is far greater than the that of other proposed models for virtual mouse, and it has many applications
(ii)	Amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to control the PC mouse functions without using the physical mouse
(iii)	The system can be used to control robots and automation systems without the usage of devices
(iv)	2D and 3D images can be drawn using the AI virtual system using the hand gestures
(v)	AI virtual mouse can be used to play virtual reality- and augmented reality-based games without the wireless or wired mouse devices
(vi)	Persons with problems in their hands can use this system to control the mouse functions in the computer
(vii)	In the field of robotics, the proposed system like HCI can be used for controlling robots
(viii)	In designing and architecture, the proposed system can be used for designing virtually for prototyping
